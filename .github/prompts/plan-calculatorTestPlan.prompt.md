## Test Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Unit Tests (Jest)

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

- Run on every commit
- Must pass before merge
- Aim for <500ms execution time

### Phase 2: Integration Tests (Jest + jsdom)

```bash
npm test:integration
```

- Run before pull requests
- Test DOM interactions
- Verify event handlers

### Phase 3: E2E Tests (Playwright)

```bash
npm test:e2e
```

- Run before releases
- Test real browser behavior
- Cross-browser verification

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
```

### 2. Configure Jest

Create `jest.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 100,
      functions: 100,
      lines: 100,
      statements: 100,
    },
  },
  collectCoverageFrom: ['script.js'],
};
```

### 3. Create Test Files

- `script.test.js` - Core function tests
- `dom.test.js` - DOM interaction tests
- `e2e.spec.js` - Playwright E2E tests

---

## Success Criteria

✅ 100% code coverage achieved  
✅ All 150+ tests passing  
✅ No security vulnerabilities  
✅ E2E tests pass in all major browsers  
✅ Performance: Tests run in <2 seconds  
✅ Maintainable: Tests are clear and well-documented

---

## Test Maintenance

### Regular Updates Needed:

- Add tests for new features immediately
- Update tests when refactoring
- Review and remove flaky tests
- Keep dependencies updated

### CI/CD Integration:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    npm test -- --coverage
    npm run test:e2e
```
