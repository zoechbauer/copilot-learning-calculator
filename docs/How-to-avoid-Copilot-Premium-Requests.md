# Tips & Tricks: How to Avoid Copilot Premium Requests

## What Are Premium Requests?
Premium requests are triggered when you use advanced Copilot features such as:
- Automated code review (PR review, suggestions, fixes)
- Agent mode (Copilot acting as a coding agent for PRs)
- Deep analysis or automated actions in PRs

These requests count toward your monthly quota and may incur additional costs.

## How to Avoid Premium Requests

### 1. **Use Ask Mode for General Help**
- Use Copilot's chat or ask mode for code explanations, Q&A, and code completion.
- These are standard requests and do **not** count as premium.

### 2. **Limit Agent Mode Usage**
- Only use agent mode (automated PR review, fixes, comments) when necessary.
- Frequent use of agent mode will quickly reach your premium quota.

### 3. **Manual PR Review**
- Review and comment on pull requests manually when possible.
- Use Copilot for code suggestions, but avoid automated review actions.

### 4. **Avoid Automated PR Actions**
- Do not request Copilot to automatically fix, merge, or comment on PRs unless required.
- These actions trigger premium requests.

### 5. **Use Regular Code Completion**
- Use Copilot for code completion and inline suggestions in your editor.
- These are normal requests and do not affect your premium quota.

### 6. **Monitor Your Usage**
- Check your usage breakdown in GitHub's billing and licensing section.
- Track how many premium requests you have used and plan accordingly.

### 7. **Choose the Right Model**
- The model (GPT-4.1, GPT-5, Claude, etc.) does not determine premium status.
- Premium requests are based on feature usage, not the model.

### 8. **Batch Your Premium Actions**
- If you need agent features, batch your requests to minimize the number of premium actions.
