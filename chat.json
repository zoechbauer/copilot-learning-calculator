Let's break down what each property does:\n\nThe `display: grid` property transforms the `.buttons` element into a CSS Grid container. This means any direct child elements will become grid items that can be positioned using the grid system, rather than following the normal document flow.\n\nThe `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)` property defines the column structure of the grid. The `repeat()` function is a shorthand that creates 4 columns, each taking up `1fr` (one fraction) of the available space. The `fr` unit distributes space proportionally, so each column will be exactly 25% of the container's width. This is equivalent to writing `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr`.\n\nThe `gap: 15px` property adds consistent spacing between grid items. This creates a 15-pixel gap both horizontally between columns and vertically between rows (if the grid wraps to multiple rows). This is much cleaner than using margins, as the gap only appears *between* items, not around the outer edges.\n\n**Key benefits of this approach:**\n- **Responsive by default**: The columns automatically resize as the container width changes\n- **Clean spacing**: No margin collapse issues or complex calculations needed\n- **Flexible content**: Child elements will automatically flow into the 4-column structure, wrapping to new rows as needed\n\nThis pattern is commonly used for button toolbars, image galleries, or any interface where you want consistent, evenly-spaced items arranged in columns.",
